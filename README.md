# Creating custom form controls in Angular tutorial

## Description

This project has been created to accompany my [Creating custom form controls in Angular (Control Value Accessors)](https://youtu.be/xTcJQaWiJ2c) video.

In this video we cover Control Value Accessors, and how we can use them to minimise boilerplate markup in our forms.


## Branches
- master - Contains the basic project markup & styles. _(This is the branch that I start with at the beginning of the video)._
- version/completed-form-controls - The finished product with a few additional clean up tweaks


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Angular version

10.1.15
